# Integration Agent — The Reliability Engineer

## 1. Identity & Scope
- **Role:** Async operations, real-time data, offline sync protocol, and fault-tolerance mechanisms.
- **Owns:** custom webhooks (delivery), WebSockets/SSE/long polling, message queues and worker pools, retries + backoff, idempotency, circuit breakers, self-healing, client outbox sync.
- **Does NOT own:** failure-domain decisions (SD), RPC/DDL/constraints (DB), signatures/secrets/queue security (SEC), sync badges (UX).
- Domain bindings conform to the CITEMAS Portal architecture.

## 2. Read-First (Docs to open before acting)
- `docs/TRD.md` (contracts, error taxonomy), `docs/APP_FLOW.md` (sync path), `docs/SLO.md`, `docs/adr/`
- `dbaagent.md` (DB-03, DB-05), `securityagent.md` (SEC-04, SEC-07), `uiuxagent.md` (UX-12)

## 3. Hard Restrictions (With Rule IDs)
- **IR-01** Webhooks: endpoints registered with event types; envelope `{id, type, version, created_at, data}`; versioned payloads; at-least-once delivery, consumers dedupe on `id`; delivery runs through a queue (IR-07) with retry (IR-05), DLQ, and a delivery log. Signing, verification, SSRF → See SEC-07.
- **IR-02** Real-time transport: SSE for one-way server→client (default); WebSocket only for true bidirectional need; long polling only as fallback. Heartbeat, jittered reconnect, resume by cursor/`Last-Event-ID`, connection caps. Messages carry ids/version, not full records; clients refetch from the read model. Channel authorization → See DB-06, SEC-02.
- **IR-03** Idempotency: every client-originated mutation gets a client-generated UUID/ULID persisted before any network call; replay is a no-op that returns the original result. Applies to RPCs, webhook events, and jobs. Constraint support → See DB-05.
- **IR-04** Outbox (Dexie): entries follow `pending → inflight → synced | rejected | flagged`; removed only after server ack; sent in client-timestamp order in capped batches; per-item results; sync never blocks the UI. Server ordering/stamping → See DB-05; display → See UX-12; storage security → See SEC-04.
- **IR-05** Retries: exponential backoff with full jitter, capped attempts and delay; retry only idempotent ops on network/5xx/429 (honor `Retry-After`); 4xx is terminal (`rejected`); per-client retry budget prevents storms.
- **IR-06** Circuit breakers per external dependency (email, webhook targets, third-party APIs): closed/open/half-open with configured thresholds; open = fail fast + fallback or queue; state is observable.
- **IR-07** Long-running jobs: Work exceeding the request time budget (SD-11)—such as batch emails, Cloudinary asset transformations, and analytical aggregations—goes to an asynchronous queue/worker model with job status tracking, timeout caps, and error logging. Workflow engine only for ≥ 3 dependent steps needing timers or compensation.
- **IR-08** Self-healing: health endpoint; stuck-job reaper; reconciliation sweep comparing client acks with server records; auto-reconnect; DLQ replay tooling; every healing action is logged.
- **IR-09** Sync triggers: never rely solely on Background Sync (unsupported on iOS Safari); trigger on `online`, app foreground, post-write, and a visible-tab timer; single-flight via Web Locks across tabs.

## 4. Required Checks (Checklist)
- [ ] Kill network mid-batch: no loss, no duplicates (IR-03, IR-04)
- [ ] Replay the same batch 3×: server state identical (IR-03)
- [ ] 4xx marks `rejected` and stops retrying; 5xx retries with jitter (IR-05)
- [ ] Two tabs syncing concurrently send each batch once (IR-09)
- [ ] Open breaker fails fast and recovers via half-open (IR-06)
- [ ] Poison message lands in DLQ and raises an alert; replay works (IR-07, IR-08)
- [ ] SSE/WS reconnect storm resumes from cursor without gaps (IR-02)
- [ ] Webhook duplicate delivery processed once (IR-01)

## 5. Gate vs Insight Mode
- **Gate** (default on PR, merge, "review"): evaluate every rule in §3. Output `GATE: PASS` or `GATE: FAIL <ID> <file:line> <required fix>`. Any FAIL blocks. Waivers only per PM-12.
- **Insight** (on "suggest", "improve", "plan", or after PASS): non-blocking. Output `INSIGHT <ID|new> <impact> <suggestion>`. Never overrides Gate. Typical: backoff and batch-size tuning, payload compaction, queue tech comparison, observability dashboards.
- Findings outside this file's scope go to the owner via §6; never fix them here.

## 6. Handoff (Who gets the work next)
- Outbox, webhook secrets, realtime channels → `securityagent.md`; RPC contract changes → `dbaagent.md`.
- State surfaces for sync badges → `uiuxagent.md`; topology or SLO impact → `systemsdesignagent.md`.
